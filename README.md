## 🔥LAB545: Create and Manage sensitive information types and labels

*Workshop for Microsoft AI Tour 2026 – Microsoft Purview Information Protection*

### Session Description

As organizations adopt AI tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot, protecting sensitive data is essential. In this hands-on session, you'll use Microsoft Purview Information Protection and DLP to classify and secure project data. You'll create custom sensitive information types, publish sensitivity labels, and add a DLP policy that prevents Copilot from processing protected content.

### 🧠 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, learners will be able to:

- Create and test custom sensitive information types in Microsoft Purview
- Build and publish sensitivity labels to classify project data
- Configure auto-apply labeling to protect sensitive content automatically
- Create a DLP policy that prevents Copilot from processing protected content

### 💻 Technologies Used

1. Microsoft Purview Information Protection
1. Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
1. Microsoft Purview Audit

### What you'll do

In this lab, you'll:

- Enable auditing in Microsoft Purview
- Create and test a custom sensitive information type
- Build a parent and sublabel structure for project data
- Publish sensitivity labels for manual and auto-apply use
- Configure an auto-apply policy to label project data automatically
- (Optional) Create a DLP policy that prevents Copilot from processing protected content
