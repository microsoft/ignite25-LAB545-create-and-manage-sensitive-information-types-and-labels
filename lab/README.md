These instructions are for participants of the **instructor-led** Workshop **Create and Manage sensitive information types and labels** at Microsoft AI Tour 2026. Register to attend in a city near you at [Microsoft AI Tour](https://aitour.microsoft.com/).

## Lab Overview

In this workshop, you'll use Microsoft Purview Information Protection and Data Loss Prevention (DLP) to classify and protect sensitive project data. You'll create and test custom sensitive information types, build and publish sensitivity labels, configure auto-apply labeling, and add a DLP policy that prevents Microsoft 365 Copilot from processing protected content.

If you're not attending AI Tour, you can still complete this lab using your own Microsoft 365 E5 environment with access to Microsoft Purview Information Protection and DLP.

## Prerequisites

To participate in this workshop, you'll need:

1. A laptop with internet access
   - A recent version of Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Safari is recommended
1. A Microsoft 365 E5 tenant with Microsoft Purview Information Protection and DLP enabled
1. Access to the Microsoft Purview portal (https://purview.microsoft.com)

## Get Started

To get started, open the [lab instructions](./instructions/MIP-1-information-protection.md). If time allows, continue with the [bonus task](./instructions/MIP-2-bonus-dlp.md) to extend your protection setup with a DLP policy for Copilot.
